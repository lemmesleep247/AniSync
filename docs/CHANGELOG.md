# Changelog

All notable changes to AniSync will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Inbox Read Tracking** - Notification settings gain an Inbox group. Read tracking can be switched off, leaving the inbox with no New section and letting the visit clear the count the way the website does, and opening the inbox can be set to mark everything in it read.

### Changed

- **Tab Gestures** - Two quick taps on a navigation item open that tab's search from any tab, not only from the one you are already on. A single tap on the tab you are on still scrolls it back to the top, and a tap that switches tabs still restores where you left off.

### Fixed

- **Notifications Inbox** - Notifications no longer come back as new after leaving the screen or after a newer one arrives. Read state is kept on the device per account instead of being guessed from AniList's unread count on every visit, opening a row reads that row, and the server-side reset behind Mark all read is retried until AniList accepts it. A cached profile read can no longer put a count the user has already cleared back on the badge.
- **Notifications On The Website** - Reading the last unread row one at a time now clears the count on AniList too. The site counts notifications rather than marking them, so the app reports the inbox read once nothing is left unread on the device, instead of leaving everything unread on the website unless Mark read on open was switched on.
- **Media Details** - The section tabs dock flush under the app bar on tablets and other two-pane layouts, instead of floating a status bar's height below it with content showing through the gap. (#145)
- **Navigation Rail** - The rail's action slot keeps its height on tabs that publish no action, so the destinations no longer slide up or down a moment after a tab switch, and the action itself changes with the tab rather than a transition later.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Onboarding** - A first-run flow that walks through welcome, sign-in, permission set-up (notifications, battery exemption, hibernation, widget pin), personalisation, and a closing step. Wide windows split every step into two panes, an interrupted run resumes where it stopped, and the whole flow can be replayed from developer tools.
- **Openings & Endings** - Media pages list a title's openings and endings from AnimeThemes, with episode ranges scaled against what has aired, spoiler tags, artwork badges, and a full screen behind the section arrow. On wide windows a theme opens beside the list. Playback starts unmuted and letterboxed against black, and an AnimeThemes rate limit counts down instead of failing.
- **List Indicators** - Every cover surface marks whether a title is already on one of your lists: Discover rows and hero carousel, search grid and list, related and recommended media, and character, staff and studio credits. The mark is fused into the card corner and uses the list glyphs from the design file.
- **Watch Priority** - AniList's watch priority is carried through the data layer, set from the edit sheet, marked on library cards, and used to sort, group and bulk-apply across the Library. (#131)
- **Volumes & Advanced Scoring** - Manga entries track volumes read, and the edit entry sheet is rebuilt around a pinned save bar that matches the viewer's scoring system, including per-category advanced scores, and offers to finish an entry at its last episode.
- **Library Redesign** - A queue-first layout with bulk entry mutations, sort and filter folded back into the search bar, one shared layout and empty state across every list, genres and media format carried through, and open-ended runs measured against what has actually aired.
- **Discover Redesign** - The screen is a reorderable section list, with a per-tab section order, a spotlight that stays a banner on wide layouts, a timeline that opens on today, and an empty state on every rail.
- **Forum Redesign** - A scope rail in place of the five-way feed switcher, a feed picker sheet, a reorder-sections sheet, sorting by column and direction in the Library's sheet shape, a four-band thread card, a flattened comment tree behind one furniture bar, and a thread title that hands over to the app bar as it scrolls.
- **Feed Redesign** - Scope, filter and media type on one rail, a timeline grouped by day and by catch-up run, runs of one person's list updates collapsed, and new activity offered instead of reshuffling what you are reading.
- **Media Details Redesign** - The page is rebuilt around a tracking card that carries the entry note, a ranked tag cloud behind a single spoiler shutter, an even facts grid, icons back on the section tabs, and a list menu drawn to the expressive spec.
- **Character, Staff & Studio Pages** - Rebuilt on a shared person shell with banners, spoiler aliases and list totals, rows of one height, lists that grow and page in place instead of leaving for a grid, and a wide layout built on the profile's supporting pane.
- **Profile Week Breakdown** - Activity history gains a week view, and a day opens a sheet that tells its activity kinds apart and routes each row to the media or the post.
- **Colours From Artwork** - An optional toggle themes the media page from its cover art.
- **Tab Gestures** - Tap the current tab to scroll to the top, tap twice to open search, with a settings switch for the double tap.
- **Open On** - Choose which screen a cold launch opens.
- **Notifications Inbox** - Unread rows are marked, and there is a mark-all-read action.
- **Support Card** - The first launch after an update floats a card with a one-tap route to the Donate screen. Answering it either way marks the build seen, so it asks once per update and never on a fresh install.
- **Indonesian** - Indonesian joins the in-app language picker.

### Changed

- **Widgets** - All five widgets are rebuilt on RemoteViews: scrolling lists, the Weekly Calendar design restored with larger cards, the remaining four rebuilt on one shared card language, filter toggles moved into the header, and they now follow the app's theme instead of the device's.
- **Network Layer** - Rewritten around a request budget gate: errors typed from the response body rather than the status line, a priority a coroutine sets for everything it calls, background work that yields the budget to the user, identical in-flight queries joined into one, and a spent budget reported as a block with a countdown. Toasts are typed by error kind, redesigned, and their Retry actually retries.
- **Rate Limits** - A rate limit is waited out rather than shown as a failure: details, profile and library keep their skeleton and resolve themselves, and the notice stays up for the whole block.
- **Apollo Cache** - Moved to the standalone normalized cache library, with records keyed by id, per-type expiry and daily garbage collection, so the cache stops growing without bound. Cached reads now serve the details preview and reference sections.
- **Storage** - Settings measures and clears every cache the app owns, the image disk cache ceiling is halved, images and the player release memory under pressure, downloaded updates stay in the cache directory, and caches stay out of the 25 MB backup quota.
- **Edge to Edge** - The app draws edge to edge from the root, details and profile banners run under the status bar, and the details banner opens in the image viewer.
- **Posters** - One corner radius on every poster outside the library, and a poster card that puts its title below the cover in the Discover rows and the search grid.
- **Localisation** - The last hardcoded screens, the notification tray, its toasts, link cards and relative timestamps all moved into resources and read the locale observably, so messages arrive in the app's language rather than the device's. German and Arabic are complete.
- **App Icon** - The peak mark now sits on an ink ground.
- **Background Work** - The airing schedule refreshes six hourly instead of hourly, and the unused episode update worker is gone.

### Fixed

- **Empty & Failed States** - A failed request no longer reads as an empty Following feed or blanks the whole Discover screen, a refresh that returns nothing keeps the cached library, a failed page says so instead of ending the list quietly, and a failed library save is reported above the edit sheet.
- **Profile** - The own-profile load retries and names the transport failure instead of spinning forever or claiming the user is missing, the activity map scales to the width it is given, and a day's activity list matches the day AniList counted.
- **Sign-out** - Only a real token failure signs you out on a forum delete.
- **Details** - Paged grids are keyed by identity and stay in the order the API returned them, a short synopsis keeps its own height, the sort sheet scrolls to every option, and the tab count drops when AniList only reports its 500 cap.
- **Rich Text** - A newline after a `<br>` no longer draws a second line, images size the way the stylesheet does, and images from two HTML blocks stay on separate rows. A long review body renders as lazy items.
- **Statistics** - Hero stat numbers and labels fit the width they are given so translations are not cut, and the day column measures instead of pinning to 36dp. (#132)
- **Large Screens** - A detail pane lays its screen out for the pane rather than the window, profile grids size from the pane, the bulk action bar stops stretching, and fullscreen video fits the screen it is given.
- **Media Uploads** - An upload failure names what went wrong instead of blaming the file.
- **Crash** - Dropped the deprecated `onBackPressed` override.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Shareable Cards** - Turn a media page, your stats, a review, your favourites, or a character/staff page into a branded card and save, copy, or share it. A full-screen customizer offers Auto/Light/Dark/AMOLED/Cover themes, Compact/Square/Story formats with a gradient frame, template variants (Poster media card, all-time Recap stats, Ranked favourites), an optional caption, and hide-score/hide-progress privacy toggles. Cards capture at a fixed resolution for a crisp WEBP export on every screen density.
- **Media Stats Tab** - A community Stats tab on media pages: rank chips, recent activity per day, airing score and watchers progression charts, and status/score distributions. Charts across details are tap-to-inspect with TalkBack summaries, and rankings, genres, tags, and the hashtag open a Discover search.
- **Characters & Staff Tabs** - The Cast/Staff rails are replaced by full paginated Characters and Staff tabs with grid/list views, role filter, server-side Relevance/Name sort, and a voice-actor language picker; VA thumbnails open the staff page. (#83)
- **Library Search & All Tab** - Category-aware search with a chip per matching list, an "All" tab that browses every status list merged, per-tab count badges, and matching across every title variant and notes. (#91)
- **Score on Library Cards** - Your score shows on Library list and grid cards.
- **App Lock** - Optional lock behind the device screen lock (biometric or PIN/pattern/password); locks on cold start and background return, and hides the recents preview on Android 13+. (#86)
- **New-Follower Notifications** - Push notifications for new followers with their own channel and toggle, deep-linking to the follower's profile.
- **Mutual / Follows-You Indicator** - Profiles badge whether a user follows you back. (#81)
- **More Languages** - The in-app language picker now lists every bundled language, adding Tamil and Russian plus the new French and Persian translations. Thanks to @Ether3566 (French) and حمید سامانی (Persian). Updated Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil) translations.

### Changed

- **Video Player Redesign** - The inline rich-text video player gains auto-hiding controls, a drag-to-seek scrubber with time labels, adaptive letterboxed framing for portrait/ultrawide clips, and an immersive fullscreen activity that survives rotation while keeping position and mute.
- **Notification Stacking & Channel Groups** - One tray entry per target that updates in place (batched actors, a social group summary, premiere alerts replacing advance ones), notification channels organized into Airing/Forum/Activity/Other groups, media moderation notes that expand in place, and the unread badge clears from any inbox entry.
- **Discover Search Results** - Endless scroll and a per-category list/grid toggle.
- **Favourites Sub-Tabs** - List views alongside grids, with objective metadata (media type and release year, staff occupation).
- **Shared-Element Motion** - Review banners morph into the detail hero, VA images morph into staff details, detail routes fade so the morphs own the motion, and Discover sections keep their morphs on the tapped card.

### Fixed

- **System Theme** - The app follows the system theme again, resolving dark mode from one source.
- **Stale Media Data** - Media details auto-refresh when stale, cover artwork updates instead of staying pinned to the old image, the Social tab and reviews stop serving stale cache, and pull-to-refresh revalidates stats and social previews.
- **Profile Activity & Heatmap** - Activity paginates by type server-side from a single footer trigger (#89), the heatmap refreshes instead of serving stale cache (#88), heatmap days no longer shift by one and the range ends at AniList's last counted day, and list-activity cards restore their header gap. (#90)
- **Library Dates & Rows** - Picked dates anchor to UTC so they don't land a day off (#85), recommend/forum media rows show the correct year, and the rewatching list uses the same cards as watching. (#80)
- **Details Navigation** - Tab and scroll position are kept when returning from a character/staff page, filtered Characters/Staff/media lists no longer stall pagination, and the app bar behaves during pull-to-refresh.
- **Splash Screen** - The cold-start splash matches dynamic color on Android 12+ and honors dark theme. (#84)
- **Discover** - The search overlay no longer re-opens on every return to the tab, and Trending hero covers land on their card when returning.
- **Links** - AniList URLs with a trailing slash route in-app.
- **Rich Text** - Rich content inside `<code>` styling wrappers parses correctly while real code keeps monospace.
- **Adaptive Layouts** - Sheets anchor to their pane on wide windows, and reviews open in the Discover detail pane.
- **Notifications Worker** - Background polling recovers from API errors instead of misclassifying them.
- **AMOLED** - Visited profiles keep pure blacks when profile-color tinting applies.
- **Staff Pages** - Voiced characters sort by character favourites, and the share sheet no longer squashes when the keyboard opens.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Adaptive Large-Screen UI** - On tablets, foldables, and wide windows, AniSync reflows into a two-pane list-detail layout across Library, Discover/Search, Feed, Forum, Notifications, Settings, and Profile, with a collapsible navigation rail and a contextual FAB. The split is resizable and persists across restarts, with snap/collapse drag behavior and nested navigation inside the media-detail pane. Wide windows also gain multi-column poster, favorites, and social grids, a profile statistics dashboard, and a two-pane month calendar. Phones stay single-pane with the bottom bar per Material 3 window size classes.
- **AMOLED Theme** - A pure-black dark theme that shifts the whole surface ladder down for OLED screens.
- **Library Notes & Journal** - Your list notes now surface on the media-details screen and in the Library, alongside a dedicated searchable notes journal.
- **Document-Editor Composer** - The post and review composer is redesigned as a full-screen document editor (on phones too), with a live preview alongside the editor on wide windows.
- **Expandable Details Info** - Alternative titles, synonyms, and producers are shown as expandable info pills on media details.
- **Profile Overview Overhaul** - The Overview tab now leads with a snapshot card and an activity heatmap.
- **Friends' Notes** - See other users' list notes on their profiles and in the Following section.
- **More Translations** - New Russian and Tamil translations, plus refreshed Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil), via Weblate. Thanks to @Minfinity010 (Spanish), @anicetoclucas (Portuguese, Brazil), DarkOperation (Russian), and தமிழ்நேரம் (Tamil).

### Changed

- **Settings Redesign** - Settings are restructured into a cleaner, card-based design system with shared components and a consistent settings vocabulary.
- **Status Bar Matches Screen** - The status bar tint now matches the content below it on every screen, and content is inset below the system status bar app-wide.
- **Sticky Detail Tabs** - The media-details section tabs stick to the top and track scroll.
- **Hide Blocked Users** - Blocked users are hidden from the feed, forum, and notifications. (#77)
- **Capped Activity Cards** - Long status and message cards cap with an expand toggle and scroll more steadily.
- **Donate Reframed** - Support is reframed as no-reward tips for payment-processor compliance.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate-Key Crashes** - Library entries are deduped by media id (#72) and duplicate lazy-layout keys are fixed across multiple screens (#69, thanks @GoldRift) to stop the "Key already used" crash.
- **Rotation Refetch** - Media details, threads, and status screens serve cached entries on a configuration change instead of refetching. (#73 sort persistence included)
- **Library Sort & Manga Label** - The chosen Library sort persists across restarts (#73), and the Social tab shows "Ch" instead of "Ep" for manga progress. (#74)
- **Notes Accuracy** - The detail-page note reads from the library rather than the media cache, and clearing a note empties it instead of keeping the old text.
- **Profile Activity** - The activity feed paginates and revalidates on open, the heatmap loads on entry without a pull-to-refresh, the pagination loader renders at its default size, replies thread into the correct branch, and the cached account avatar refreshes from the own profile.
- **Rich Text** - Bold renders correctly around mentions and across tags with boundary spaces preserved, fully-fenced AniList posts and bios stay centered, and the bio editor no longer corrupts markup. Parsed rich text is cached so it no longer re-settles on scroll-back.
- **SVG Rendering** - The SVG snapshot is dropped once the live WebView has drawn, and live SVG WebViews are gated by animation cost.
- **Shared-Element Transition** - The Library-to-Details shared-element transition is smoother.
- **Library Badges** - The behind badge and airing time rotate so both stay visible.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Multi-Account Support** - Sign in to multiple AniList accounts and add, switch, or remove them from the profile-header quick-switch sheet or the AniList Settings screen. Each account keeps its own library and profile cached, so switching back is instant; tokens are stored in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
- **All-Account Background Notifications** - The notification worker now polls every signed-in account each cycle, not just the active one. Notifications are tagged per account (showing the account name when more than one is signed in), and tapping one switches to the owning account before opening the target.
- **Forum Advanced Search & Media Discussions** - A Discover-style filtered thread search (by media, category, author, sort, and subscribed-only), a per-media Discussions section, and a dedicated media-threads screen. Create-thread can be pre-attached to a media, with caps of 3 forum and 2 media categories and a scroll-to-top FAB.
- **Translate via External Apps** - A translate action on the media synopsis, character and staff bios, and reviews hands the text to an installed translator (TranslateYou, DeepL, or Google Translate).
- **Recommendations & Review Editor on Details** - A recommendations grid with a "See all" screen, a recommend action, and a rich-text review editor to create, edit, or delete your own review.
- **New Discover Sections** - Newly Added and a Recent Reviews carousel, each with a "See all" screen; the Recent Reviews list adds sort, media, and author filters.
- **AniList Account Options Sync** - Read and edit your AniList account options (content, title language, social, activity, profile color) with a local-first model that applies edits instantly and reconciles website changes through a conflict prompt.
- **Resume Where You Left Off** - Reopens on the last-used bottom-nav tab and remembers the Library type/view, Feed scope/filter, Forum tab/category, and Discover type.
- **Activity Subscribe** - Subscribe to or unsubscribe from an activity on its detail screen.
- **Catbox Account Userhash** - An optional userhash binds Catbox uploads to your account so you can view and delete them later.
- **More Translations** - A large Spanish update plus refreshed Portuguese (Brazil) and Arabic, via Weblate. Thanks to @Minfinity010, @nubesurrealista, and @DiegoLpVn (Spanish), @anicetoclucas (Portuguese, Brazil), and @j-neko (Arabic).

### Changed

- **New App Icon & Branding** - Redesigned adaptive app icon (white background with a blue gradient emblem), refreshed notification icon, README logo, and store graphics.
- **Media Details in Tabs** - Detail sections are grouped into Overview, Characters, and Social tabs instead of one long scroll; the header and favorite/share row stay pinned, and the Characters tab hides when a title has no cast or staff.
- **Review Surfaces Redesigned** - Reworked review detail screen, sheet, and cards around one shared component set with a segmented like/dislike pill and inline helpful/score voting.
- **Rich Text & Link Cards Overhaul** - Redesigned AniList link cards for media, character, staff, and user links (cover-tinted, bounded width, accent border); SVG badges and widgets render through a hardened WebView; full-width images display at their declared width and `img align` floats text beside them.
- **AniList Settings Consolidated** - Account management merged into a single "AniList Settings" screen with Donate and Translate shortcuts; "Open in web" now opens a real browser instead of looping back into the app.
- **Profile & Feed Color Tinting** - An opt-in toggle tints a visited profile with that user's AniList profile color, and list-activity feed cards are tinted with the media's cover color.
- **Unified Activity Cards** - Status, message, and list activities render through one `ActivityCard` with consistent share and subscribe actions across feed and profile.
- **Following Cards** - Show episode progress alongside the score in one adaptive-width pill.

### Fixed

- **NSFW Leaks** - Adult media no longer appears in the feed or search when the account has "Show adult content" disabled, matching the website. (#53)
- **4-Byte Emoji Truncation** - Emoji above U+FFFF in reviews, bios, and list notes no longer silently truncate the rest of the field.
- **Search Bar Self-Reopen** - The Material 3 search bar on Library, Discover, and Forum no longer reopens itself while collapsing on older devices (API 26 / EMUI 8). (#51)
- **Duplicate-Key Crash** - Paginated review, following, profile, forum, and notification lists are deduped on append to stop the "Key already used" crash. (#56)
- **Notification Timing & Routing** - Notifications show the event time rather than the poll time; taps route to the intended target instead of the last screen; airing-notification taps now open the app.
- **Media & Video Loading** - Images and videos hosted on CDNs that bot-filter the default User-Agent (Catbox, Imgur) no longer fail with 403 or IO errors.
- **Inline AniList Links** - Inline links in posts and descriptions are now reliably clickable and open media details.
- **FAB Overlay Leak** - The floating action button on an exiting details screen no longer floats over the destination.
- **Uncropped "None" Avatar** - The profile-header avatar renders at its natural aspect ratio when the avatar shape is set to None.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Weekly Airing Calendar** - New in-app screen showing the week's airing schedule, with a pill-style day selector, a "today" marker, and a jump-to-today chip.
- **In-App Sponsors Screen** - Dedicated Sponsors screen whose list is synced from GitHub Sponsors via CI.
- **Avatar Shape Customization** - Choose an avatar shape (Clover-8 leaf and others) and toggle a global profile background. A shared `UserAvatar` renders consistently across review cards, profile, and other avatar sites.
- **Library Pull-to-Refresh** - Pull-to-refresh on the Library tabs.
- **More Languages** - Added Spanish and Portuguese (Portugal) translations and refreshed Arabic, German, and Portuguese (Brazil) via Weblate.

### Changed

- **Rate-Limit Resilience** - Added a stale-while-revalidate `ResourceFetcher` primitive, cut profile/search request volume to stop rate-limit stalls, and surfaced rate-limit feedback through the toast system.
- **Detail-Push Enter Animation** - Detail screens pushed onto the stack now animate in.
- **About Screen Refresh** - Reworked About screen and open-source acknowledgements list.
- **Hide Developer Tools** - Developer Tools can be disabled/hidden from settings.

### Fixed

- FAB now stays above content during the media-details enter transition and above the bottom nav bar on Feed and Forum.
- Profile keeps its scroll position when navigating back.
- Custom lists exclude `status:*` entries; studio cover sizes are uniform.
- Clover-8 item-icon shape is preserved when the avatar shape is set to None.
- In-app notification taps route through the `NavController` instead of restarting the activity.
- Voice-actor count badge no longer clips on character screens.
- The in-app App Language sheet now lists every bundled language; it previously only offered English, German, and Arabic.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

#### Editing & Composition
- **Edit + Delete Across Posts** - Threads, thread comments, activity replies, and TextActivity status posts gain edit + delete actions, gated by authorship; delete confirms via `AlertDialog`. Backed by `SaveThread` / `SaveThreadComment` / `SaveActivityReply` / `SaveTextActivity` id-aware mutations + `DeleteThread` / `DeleteThreadComment` ops. Closes #9.
- **DM Edit + Delete from Any Profile** - Overflow menu on direct messages no longer gated by `isOwnProfile`. `canDelete` / `canEdit` derive from authorship; mod-authored messages hide delete to prevent 401 logout. `ActivityRepository.saveMessageActivity(id=...)` added. `ActivityFields` / `GetActivity` fetch `textRaw` / `rawMessage` so edits prefill with markdown.
- **RichText Bio Editor** - Profile bio editor swapped from `AlertDialog` to `RichTextInputScreen`; `GetUserProfile` now fetches `aboutRaw` so the editor round-trips markdown rather than corrupting via the rendered HTML.
- **Media Upload in Composers** - New `MediaAttachSheet` uploads images, GIFs, and videos to a configurable host (Catbox / Litterbox 1h/24h/72h / custom multipart) and inserts the AniList `img%(url)` markdown at the cursor. `MediaSizeChoice` (small / medium / large / custom px or %) drives the inserted size. Dedicated 10-minute-timeout OkHttpClient streams from content URIs via `UriRequestBody` so large files don't OOM. Closes #6.
- **IME Sticker / GIF Insert** - `RichTextScaffold` and `RichTextInputSheet` accept stickers and GIFs straight from Gboard via `contentReceiver`; uploads run in the background and surface a compact `ImeUploadStrip` (filename + animated progress + cancel) above the format bar.
- **Discard Draft Confirmation** - Composers warn before discarding unsaved drafts via `AlertDialog`; sheets are partially-expandable.
- **Forum Media Categories** - The thread compose sheet now attaches `mediaCategories` on `SaveThread` instead of inlining a markdown link; selected media render as removable chips next to forum category chips, and re-tapping in the search list removes.

#### Library & Navigation
- **Drag-to-Reorder Library Tabs** - All Library tabs reorderable with per-tab visibility toggling; visibility persists across sessions. Closes #10.
- **Per-Type Last-Tab Memory** - Library remembers the last selected tab per media type (Anime / Manga independently) and restores it on reopen. Falls back to the first visible tab if the saved tab was deleted/hidden. Closes #11.
- **Compact Nav Bar** - New `CompactNavBar` replaces M3 `NavigationBar`: floating-pill or anchored-rounded-top styles, user-toggleable label visibility with height animation, and corner-radius slider (0-36 dp). Floating-bar mode renders as a content overlay so scrollable content shows through its side margins; tab screens consume `LocalMainNavBarInset` as bottom contentPadding. `navigateSafely()` absorbs rapid taps during transitions. Parallax + scale push/pop transitions for detail screens. Closes #20.
- **Collapsing Hero Top Bar App-Wide** - Extracted `CollapsingTopBarScaffold` applied to `ReviewDetail`, `ForumCategory`, `Notifications`, `ActivityDetail`, `ThreadDetail`, `GridsScreen`, `SectionGridScreen`. Synchronous nested-scroll height updates eliminate the bar/content padding desync; collapsed title vertically aligns with action icons; expanded state stops consuming the gesture so inner `PullToRefreshBox` can still trigger refresh.

#### Search & Discover
- **Advanced Search Rebuild** - Full AniList filter parity: unified chip bar + per-filter bottom sheets, Type chip (All / Anime / Manga / Characters / Staff / Users / Studios) that overrides the screen-level Anime/Manga selector, M3-spec year-range grid (1940..current+1) replacing the dual wheel, persisted list/grid view toggle, results header with category chip strip. `IncludeExcludeChip` restyled to M3 filter-chip spec. More filters consolidated into one sheet of inline-expanding groups with a Reset action. Adult genres gated behind a settings toggle. Closes #18.
- **Discover Hero Carousel Rewrite** - From-scratch MD3-polish rewrite of the trending hero carousel.

#### Toasts & Alerts
- **Global TopAlertToast System** - Toast-based alert system (`ToastManager`, `ToastMessage`, `ToastType`, `TopAlertToast`, `TopToastHost`) replaces every Material `Snackbar` site (Feed, Forum, Library, Profile, Settings, Forum subscreens). Swipe-to-dismiss, countdown timers for retry/rate-limit, theme-aware surfaces.
- **Error Code + Countdown on Result.Error** - `Result.Error` now carries HTTP status code and countdown seconds; `NetworkUtil.safeApiCall` populates them from `ApiError` and Apollo exception types so the UI can show contextual error toasts with retry timers.

#### Crash Handling
- **In-App Crash Reporter** - `CrashReportActivity` surfaces uncaught exceptions in a themed screen with Copy-and-Exit; runs in a separate `:crash` process so it survives main app death. `AppInfo` helper formats version / Android / ABI for both bug reports and crashes. About screen gains a "Copy app info" entry. GitHub bug/feature issue templates added.

#### Details
- **Selectable Text + Long-Press Copy** - Titles, synopsis, character/staff name card, attributes wrapped in `SelectionContainer` for partial-text selection. Long-press copies the full string from non-text-selectable items (cast tile, external-link chip, voiced-character row, voice-actor card). Per-content-type `ClipData` labels (Title, Synopsis, Character name, Staff name, External link) so the OS clipboard / Gboard chip shows useful provenance. Closes #8.

#### Settings & Look-and-Feel
- **Cover Image Quality Setting** - Look-and-Feel setting (Extra Large / Large / Medium) applies app-wide without restart. `LocalCoverQuality` `CompositionLocal` flips at the root from `AppSettings.coverQuality`; library and media-details Room entities gain `coverMedium` / `coverLarge` / `coverExtraLarge` columns (auto-migration v12 -> v13).
- **Expressive Settings UI** - Modernized cards and improved search; missing search strings (`search_settings`, `clear_search`, `no_settings_found`) added.
- **Developer Tools Unlock** - Tap the About-screen version label 7x to permanently unlock Developer Tools in release builds; crash-trigger group still gated behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG`.

#### Studio & People
- **Studio Detail Screen** - New `StudioDetailsScreen` with hero, attributes, works list, fav toggle, share. VA / staff / studio stat cards clickable across Statistics, Search, Profile Favorites, MediaDetails. Room schema bump v13 -> v14 (`studioId` column on `media_details`).
- **Stats Cards Redesign** - VoiceActor / Staff cards adopt a tombstone-arch image with uppercase bold name; Studio card text-only with tertiary gradient and fixed height to stop `LazyRow` jitter; release-year histogram and donut chart shrunk so counts/years no longer wrap.

#### Localization
- **Weblate Integration** - Every UI string externalized to `strings.xml`; `app_name` references switched to placeholders to prevent translation; Weblate workflow added.

#### Branding & Typography
- **New App Icon** - Updated launcher icon, monochrome variant, notification icon, and F-Droid metadata. Resolves #12.
- **Google Sans Flex Typography** - Centralized variable-font system swaps Roboto Flex for Google Sans Flex; M3 Expressive scale; ROND 100 (fully rounded) is the new app-wide default. Glance widget layer migrated to shared role tokens.
- **Per-Category Font Axis Playground** - Developer tool: weight / width / optical-size / slant / roundness per M3 role (Display / Headline / Title / Body / Label) with an "All" shortcut. Persisted as a JSON blob in `AppSettings`.
- **Wavy Progress Indicators** - Material 3 wavy circular / linear progress variants across upload, refresh, and other progress surfaces.

### Changed
- **Unified RichText Composer Family** - Consolidated `MarkdownComposeSheet`, `MarkdownFullEditor`, `MessageComposerSheet`, and `CreateThreadScreen` into `RichText{Scaffold,InputSheet,InputScreen,FormatBar,Ops}` under `presentation/components/richtext/`. `RichTextInsertController` exposes a cursor-aware insert handle. Migrated to `TextFieldState` + `BasicTextField` for in-place mutations via `TextFieldState.edit`.
- **Composer IME Docking** - Toolbar docks to the IME via `imePadding()` (mirrored in `RichTextInputSheet` via `navigationBarsPadding() + imePadding()`); each modifier consumes only its own inset.
- **Input Max Length** - Title and body fields enforce AniList max length via `MaxLengthInputTransformation`; `canSubmit` gates on `withinMaxLength`; `ForumThreadInputScreen` title clamped via `take(TitleBounds.max)`.
- **Litterbox Duration Selector** - `LITTERBOX_1H/24H/72H` consolidated into a single `LITTERBOX` host with an expiry duration setting. Imgur uploader removed.
- **Profile Header Polish** - `RainbowDonatorBadge` / `RegularDonatorBadge` extracted to isolate animation invalidation; `joinedDate` and gradient brushes cached via `remember`; profile action buttons switched to `IconButton` variants.
- **Notifications Filter Snapshots** - `NotificationsViewModel` caches per-filter snapshots so chip switches are instant. Worker passes `typeIn` so it actually receives the configured notification types.
- **Toast Performance** - Pre-calculated `surfaceColor` / `codeBackgroundColor` on `ToastType`; `codeToTypeMap` for O(1) `fromCode`; `CountdownTimerText` extracted so only the timer recomposes; swipe animation defers state reads to draw via `graphicsLayer`; `AtomicInteger` IDs replace `UUID`; `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` for safer state collection.
- **Memory Footprint** - Coil bitmaps enforced as `RGB_565` (halves cover-art memory); ExoPlayer instances use a strict `DefaultLoadControl` capping per-video buffer at 2 MB (down from 32 MB); `CoverImage` strings deduplicated and marked `@Immutable`; `ExoPlayer.prepare()` deferred until the player attaches to the UI.
- **Main Thread Offload** - Notification scheduling and update checks moved off the main thread to `Dispatchers.IO`; `MainActivity` refactored to extract update handling into `AppUpdateHandler`; auth token parsing optimized.
- **Upload Progress Smoothing** - `UriRequestBody` chunk bumped to 256 KB with a 50 ms minimum gap between `onProgress` fires plus a guaranteed final fire on EOF; response reads bounded via `peekBody` (4 KB for URL responses, 64 KB for custom-host JSON) so a misconfigured host can't OOM the parser; `retryOnConnectionFailure` disabled on the upload client.
- **`Menu` Primitive** - M3 Expressive dropdown menu wrapper with item / divider / gap DSL covering segmented shapes, group containers, partial-width dividers, refined motion. Adopted across CharacterDetails sort field, activity-card overflow, PaletteStyle selector.

### Fixed
- **Emoji Truncation in Posts** - 4-byte UTF-8 codepoints silently truncated posts in AniList's utf8 (3-byte) MySQL column. `AniListTextEncoder.encodeForAniList` now replaces every codepoint above U+FFFF with its decimal HTML entity (e.g. `🤔` -> `&#129300;`) at the wire boundary across all seven mutation sites (forum body/title/comments, activity text/messages, profile messages); composer keeps showing raw emoji.
- **Catbox Upload Reliability** - HTTP/2 edge intermittently RST'd upload streams ("stream was reset: PROTOCOL_ERROR") and the default OkHttp UA tripped Catbox's bot filter → 412 "Invalid uploader". Pinned `Protocol.HTTP_1_1` and `AniSync/<ver> (Android <sdk>)` UA on the shared media-upload OkHttpClient; residual 412 errors map to a "switch to Litterbox" hint instead of the raw response.
- **Auth Storage Recovery** - `EncryptedSharedPreferences` AEADBadTagException (corrupt keystore on some OEMs) used to lock the user out; auth flow now detects it and recovers cleanly.
- **Deleted-Activity Deep Links** - Opening a deleted activity via notification deep link no longer hits a dead-end error screen. `ActivityRepositoryImpl` throws `ApiError.GraphQLError(404)`; `ActivityDetailViewModel` detects 404 in `load()`, shows a `TopAlertToast`, and pops via `finishedEvents`.
- **Mod-Authored DM Delete** - Deleting a moderator's message activity used to trigger a 401 logout. `ActivityFields` and `GetActivity` now fetch `moderatorRoles` on the messenger; `isAuthorMod` mapped onto `UserActivity` / `ActivityDetail`; `canDelete` guarded across `ActivityDetailScreen` / `ProfileActivitySection` / `RecentUpdatesSection`. `AuthorizationInterceptor` also refactored to extract operation name from the request body (Apollo 4.x) and detect permission errors in HTTP 200 GraphQL responses.
- **Duplicate Forum Threads** - `ForumViewModel` deduplicates threads by id when appending pages.
- **Rich-Text Image Width Crash** - Malformed AniList markdown (e.g. `img<width>(url)` with an enormous width) overflowed Compose `Constraints` (~262143 px max) and crashed the layout pass. Absolute width clamped to `MAX_RICH_IMAGE_WIDTH_DP` (3000dp); percent width clamped to `0f..1f`.
- **Memory Caches Bounded + Glance Leak** - Bounded internal caches, fixed a Glance leak, added OOM crash protection.
- **Compact Nav Bar Label Clipping** - 20 dp rounded-corner clip wrapping the bottom-nav item Column nibbled bold-Discover and other wide labels; clip dropped (no ripple to contain). Nav labels and `AnimatedTab` get `maxLines = 1, softWrap = false, overflow = Ellipsis` so long locale strings ellipsize cleanly. Arabic `nav_profile` shortened (`الملف`); missing `nav_feed` entries added for `ar` (`النشاط`) and `de` (`Feed`).
- **Compact Nav Bar M3 Alignment** - Reserve label-height padding when labels hidden; active indicator pill to 32 dp tall; item padding 12 dp top / 16 dp bottom across both nav-bar styles.
- **Discover Bottom Inset** - Dropped leftover `bottom = 80.dp` hardcoded on `DiscoverContent`'s padding; the inner `LazyColumn` already reserves space via `LocalMainNavBarInset`. Added 24 dp on top of the inset so the last row gets breathing room above the floating pill.
- **Settings Search Strings + Shape Clip** - Added missing `search_settings` / `clear_search` / `no_settings_found` strings; `MaterialShapes.Clover8Leaf` converted via `toShape()` so it works with `clip()`.
- **Search Polish** - View-mode toggle collapsed to a single icon button; year filter rebuilt to M3 year-grid spec; adult genres gated; wheel-picker edges softened.
- **Toolbar Polish** - `STATUS` filter uses `AutoMirrored` icon; `TopAppBar` colors deprecation fixed; redundant `else` branch in `ThreadDetailViewModel` removed; `onBackPressed` deprecated on `CrashReportActivity`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

#### Feed
- **Feed Tab** - New top-level Feed tab between Discover and Forum with a Global/Following scope toggle, All/Status/List filters, Anime/Manga sub-filter, and a FAB status composer backed by `SaveTextActivity`.
- **Pinned Activities** - Activity queries now sort by `[PINNED, ID_DESC]` so pinned text activities float to the top of feeds.

#### Notifications
- **Notifications Inbox** - Dedicated inbox screen reachable from the Profile bell, with All / Airing / Status / Messages / Forum / Follows / Media filters, like-grouping per target, and inline rich-text previews.
- **Unread Badge** - Profile bell and bottom-nav Profile destination share a single `NotificationBadgeStore` driven by `Viewer.unreadNotificationCount`; nav badge collapses to a small dot when Profile is the selected destination, counts above 999 render "999+" with a pluralized TalkBack label.
- **Streaming Availability Delay** - New 0-180 minute slider that holds back airing-episode alerts until `now >= createdAt + delay`, lining notifications up with when episodes are actually watchable on slower streaming sites.

#### Social Interactions
- **"Liked by" Sheet** - Tap any like-count on an activity, activity reply, forum thread, or forum comment to open a bottom sheet listing the users who liked it. New `GetActivityLikes`, `GetActivityReplyLikes`, `GetThreadLikes`, and `GetThreadCommentLikes` queries back the four target types.
- **Tap-to-Like and Delete on Activity Cards** - Like and comment counts on feed/profile activity cards become 48dp pill buttons; tapping the heart toggles the like with optimistic flip, and an owner-only 3-dot overflow exposes Delete behind an `AlertDialog`. `ToggleActivityLike` now covers `ListActivity` (previously only `TextActivity` / `MessageActivity` were handled).
- **Following Section on Media Details** - New horizontal section listing the viewer's followed users' status, score, and progress for the current media (via `Page.mediaList(isFollowing: true)`), with color-coded status pills and a "See All" pagination sheet. Hidden when nobody followed has the media on their list.

#### Forum
- **Bidirectional Comment Paging** - `ForumRepository.findCommentPage` runs a client-side binary search over the page space (with an in-memory cache) so deep-linked comments anchor to the page that actually contains them. UI tracks `loadedPageRange` / `lastPage` / `totalComments` and exposes Load earlier (prepend), Load more (append), and Jump-to-page actions via a new `PageProgressPill` and `PageJumperBottomSheet`.
- **Client-Side Comment Sort** - AniList ignores `Page.threadComments(sort:)`, so Newest/Oldest is now applied in the repository (always fetch ascending, reverse page order and within-page rows for Newest).
- **Last-Reply Pill Targets** - "Last by USERNAME" pills on forum threads and activity cards now open the thread/activity scrolled to the latest reply via `replyCommentId` / `lastReplyId` rather than navigating to the replier's profile.

#### Tooling
- **Manual Release Workflow** - Added a manually triggered signed-release APK GitHub Actions workflow that uploads each APK as a separate versioned artifact.

### Changed
- **Activity Card Redesign** - `RecentUpdateCard` rebuilt with cover-left layout, author header, annotated status text, and a footer with last-reply pill plus reply/like stats. `ActivityPreviewCard` and `ForumThreadCard` share a new `AuthorRow` and `StatBadge` for reuse in `ProfileSocialSection`. `ListActivity` GraphQL fragment now selects `user`, so MEDIA_LIST entries carry author info.
- **Profile Refresh Parallelism** - Viewer-name lookup is skipped when the cache already has a username, and the activities query runs in parallel with favourites pagination, cutting pull-to-refresh latency.
- **Data-Layer Performance Overhaul** - `java.util.Calendar` replaced with `java.time` (5-10x faster date mapping); `LibraryDao` "smart merge" via single-pass partition + batched SQLite deletes; cached `ZoneId.systemDefault()` and `ThreadSort` lookups; reduced network round-trips in `LibraryRepository` via reused `Viewer` data and `CacheAndNetwork` policies.
- **Parser Performance** - Hoisted/compiled regex constants in `RichTextNormalizer`, `RichTextHtmlParser`, and `CharacterDescriptionParser`; chained `String.replace` calls replaced with single-pass `StringBuilder` rewriter for HTML entities and setext underlines (O(n) vs O(n²)); manual integer-based `formatScore` fast path bypasses `String.format` locale lookups.
- **Presentation Performance** - `LibraryViewModel` pre-caches sort titles and uses a direction-aware comparator to avoid full-list reversals; custom-list membership tests and sort lookups switched to `HashSet`/`HashMap` for O(1) lookups; hand-rolled `stripHtml` scan replaces regex-based stripping.
- **Markdown Composer** - New shared `MarkdownComposeSheet` replaces `ReplyBottomSheetContent` across Feed, Forum threads, and Activity detail; uses `imePadding` + `verticalScroll` so the keyboard no longer hides the input.
- **Forum Card Surface** - `ForumThreadCard` container bumped to `surfaceContainerLow` for clearer separation; `distinctBy` on thread id when concatenating paginated results fixes the "Key already used" `LazyColumn` crash.
- **Dependency Bumps** - Compose BOM (2026.03.01 -> 2026.04.01), Navigation Compose (2.9.7 -> 2.9.8), Material 3 (1.5.0-alpha17 -> alpha18), kotlinx.serialization (1.10.0 -> 1.11.0), JSoup (1.22.1 -> 1.22.2); Compose animation/runtime graduated 1.11.0-rc01 -> 1.11.0.
- **README & Screenshots** - Refreshed README with new screenshots, F-Droid version badge, and `flat`-style shields; replaced `fastlane phoneScreenshots` with the new set.

### Fixed
- **Favourite Toggle Snap-Back** - `MediaDetails` favourite heart now flips optimistically on tap and trusts the `ToggleFavourite` mutation result; the previous attempt derived state from paged `MediaConnection` membership, which mis-reported "not favourited" when the viewer had more than 25 favourites of that media type. Mutation success is now the authority; UI rolls back only on error.
- **Activity Like on Other Profiles** - Tap-to-like was gated behind an own-profile check; ungated since like is a viewer-level action against any activity (delete remains owner-only).
- **Search Overlay Navigation Loop** - Discover, Library, and user-result search Popups stayed on top of detail destinations on Android 16 (predictive back, API 36), causing tap/back events to re-push the route in a loop. Search bar state now collapses before navigation across all three entry points; `launchSingleTop` added to detail navigation.
- **Debug-Bumped Unread Count** - Server-side and debug-only unread counts now tracked in separate slots; profile resume only refreshes the server slot, so a debug bump survives until the inbox sends `resetNotificationCount=true`.
- **Inbox Subtitle Rendering** - Notification subtitles strip HTML to a plaintext two-line excerpt; embedded videos and AniList media-link cards no longer overflow the card, and empty/whitespace bodies collapse cleanly.
- **List Activity Verb** - `ListActivity` now reads `ANIME_LIST` / `MANGA_LIST` from the activity's own type field, so the verb no longer says "anime list update" when the content is a manga read.
- **Animated Avatars** - User avatars in the Following section, "Liked by" sheet, and elsewhere use `avatar.large` with `allowHardware(false)` to keep animated GIF/WebP avatars from freezing on the first frame.
- **Activity Detail for List Updates** - `GetActivity` now handles `ListActivity`, so card taps no longer hit "Unsupported activity type".

## [1.5.4] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- Disable AGP-injected `dependenciesInfo` block (`includeInApk = false`, `includeInBundle = false`) so the upstream-signed APK on GitHub Releases passes F-Droid's reproducible-build scanner. The block embeds Play Store dependency-reporting metadata that F-Droid's scanner flags as an extra signing block.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Downgrade `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` from 37 to 36 so the F-Droid buildserver can build the app. SDK Platform 37 is still in preview and is not yet in F-Droid's signed transparency log; AGP installs it to `android-37.0` but R8 looks up `android-37`, which fails. Will re-bump once SDK 37 is final.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Remove `org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver-convention` plugin from `settings.gradle.kts` to satisfy the F-Droid build scanner (no `jvmToolchain` calls used the resolver).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Fastlane metadata for F-Droid submission (title, descriptions, icon, screenshots, changelogs).

### Changed
- Release builds disable VCS info embedding for reproducibility on F-Droid.
- Remove unused `androidx.ui-text-google-fonts` dependency.

### Security
- Add `keystore.properties.example` to document the signing config without exposing credentials.

- **Markdown Recovery** - Fixed mangled markdown links and nested markdown image parsing issues.
- **Rich Text Line Breaks** - Preserved expected line breaks and tightened inline grouping behavior.
- **SVG Rendering Issues** - Fixed SVG icon/image rendering in details external-link chips and rich content contexts.
- **Layout Stability** - Reduced visual layout shifts during image/video/rich-content loading.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Custom List Classification** - Library grouping now uses AniList `isCustomList` metadata (with a safe fallback) instead of name matching, preventing status lists like Rewatching/Rereading from being misclassified as custom lists.
- **Custom List Order Sync** - Custom list order now reconciles against API results even when the API list is empty, removing stale local ghost custom lists.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Score Slider Color Mapping** - Normalized score color thresholds against each active score format (`POINT_3`, `POINT_5`, `POINT_10`, `POINT_10_DECIMAL`, `POINT_100`) so visual feedback now scales consistently.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

#### Library & Tracking

- **Enhanced Thread Parsing** - Parses native `@User` mentions to properly reconstruct "flat" AniList threads into a Reddit-style comment tree.
- **Improved UI & Animations** - Added organic curved lines for comment tracking, animated scroll-to highlighted comments.

### Changed
- **Centralized Errors & Rate Limiting** - A robust networking system that properly handles 429 Rate Limits, 401 Unauthorized errors (with re-auth prompts), network drops, and GraphQL-level structural errors across all repositories.
- **Html/Markdown Parsing** - Overhauled the underlying `RichTextParser` to fully support recursive structures like nested blockquotes, custom tables, inline images, code blocks, and spoilers without visual glitches.
- **Media Thumbnails** - Explicit cache policies logic for better UI performance out-of-the-box.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Initial documentation suite with Mermaid diagrams
- Room database migration infrastructure
- Schema export for migration testing

### Changed
- Reset database version to 1 for clean migration path
- Enabled Room schema export for version tracking

### Fixed
- Custom seed color `Color(0x00000000)` (transparent black) was incorrectly treated as "no color set" due to 0-value collision in `AppSettings`
- Orphaned palette state when clearing custom seed color while `selectedPaletteId` is `"custom"` -- now auto-resets to `"dynamic"`
- `PaletteStyleSelector` could be interacted with in disabled contexts -- added `enabled` parameter gating expand and input
- Dynamic palette preview in `ColorSchemeSelector` ignored dark mode -- now uses `dynamicDarkColorScheme`/`dynamicLightColorScheme` on Android 12+
- Color picker hue slider state lost on configuration change -- changed from `remember` to `rememberSaveable`
- Dynamic palette option was shown on pre-Android 12 devices where it is unsupported -- now filtered out
- Orphaned palette state when device conditions change (e.g., restored backup from Android 12+ device to pre-12) -- added `LaunchedEffect` auto-reset
- `PaletteStyleSelector` was interactive when Dynamic palette was selected (palette style has no effect on dynamic colors) -- now disabled
- `getTitleLanguageLabel()` and `getTitleLanguageExample()` in `LookAndFeelScreen` were unnecessarily public -- made `private`

### Removed
- Legacy migration code (MIGRATION_12_13)
